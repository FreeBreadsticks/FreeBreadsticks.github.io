Let's start at the beginning..

I think I've always been a nerd. Since I can remember I have loved to learn, read and play video games.  I'll never forget the first time I beat Ocarina of Time on the N64. It changed my life. Video games were more than just games now, they evoked emotion and thoughtfulness from me. I realized at this time that I would always love this feeling of learning, overcoming, and accomplishing a great task. I realized, also, I could do this while exercising my favorite things: learning, reading, and playing. Since then, I have gone to college and earned a degree in game design. Although, originally, I thought myself as an artist and designer. I have now embraced the other challenges involved in making games. Namely: coding.

Coding - the new gaming

Coding has become my *new game* of sorts. It forces me out of my comfort zone (the way Resident Evil does in those particularly scary parts!). It makes me yearn to understand. It makes me feel absolutely *amazing* when I solve difficult tasks. All this aside, it offers me freedom for boredom and a terrific sense of accomplishment. I was not a natural at it by any means. The first time I saw code I didn't even know what syntax meant. It made me feel like I wasn't good enough and I almost switched degrees! Luckily for me I had a couple of great friends that encouraged me and I stuck through it. Finally things began to click and I was able to truly see the beauty of coding. I began to apply my creativity to it and the doors flew open! I found a new outlet and I was extremely excited for it. It was eerily similar to beating Ocarina of Time.

##*me trying not to panic*

But, why?

Feelings and history behind, there is a lot of opportunity. Software devs are highly employable and because technology is everywhere there is a potential to work anywhere! I hate the idea of being trapped because of work and revel in the idea of traveling the world. I doubt any of it is going anywhere soon so the job security is also a huge plus. Technology and software changes and grows all the time. This allows me to change and grow with it. Every time I feel like I'm in a rut it's usually because I'm not pushing myself hard enough. Developing hardly ever has me feeling that way. And even though it can be stressful, all of the communities I have seen are also wonderful and ready to teach and help you grow. Opening myself up to code has given me a creative outlet I never thought I would have and I am so pleased that I ended up down this path.
